        The inner workings and social behavior of the emperor penguin are another large contributing
        factor to the success the penguin has seen in our cold south

        continent. Emperor penguins lay one egg a year. The male penguin will sit on the egg, having
        it rest on top of his feet and fold his body over it to keep it warm for an

        period of over two months. The penguin will lose up to half of his body weight as he does
        not eat during this time. The males will all huddle together within walls of ice or cliffs.
        This allows them to try and block some of the wind which can be deadly. Their combined body

        When the mother returns the father, penguin is usually hesitant to leave but will eventually
        go hunt for food for himself and his chick. Its not uncommon for a chickless mother to adopt
        or steal a chick with or without a parent, but always results in death as the mother doesnâ€™t
        have a partner to share the responsibility of caring and feeding. This seems cruel in nature
        but displays just how social these creatures are and how reliant they are on their partners
        and
