        The emperor penguin has adapted to its environment in order to survive. It has done this

        level. Having a greater density of feathers and down feathers helps keep the emperor penguin
        from freezing. The emperor penguin is known to be able to withstand -40 degrees Celsius.
        They also have a layer of fat which can be up to 3cm. They have muscles that are able to
        lift their feathers while on land and trap air between the bird and the outside, they can
        then use this to keep themselves warm. These same feathers can be flattened to create a
        waterproof layer which is great while in the water.

        The emperor penguin is able to shut down vital organs that are not being used. Its bones are
        not filled with air and allow the birds to dive to depths unprecedented for most creatures
        (recorded at 265-535m below surface level). They are able to do this by lowering their heart
        beat to 15-20 beats per minute. Having a streamlined body with wings that act as flippers
        the emperor penguin can swim at speeds of 6-9km an hour. Allowing them to dive to great
        depths to reach the food they need. Male emperor penguins also have an internal gland in
