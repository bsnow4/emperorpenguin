        <li>The emperor penguin is the largest and tallest of all penguin species.</li>
        <li>
          They are not the only penguin to live in Antarctica but they are the only species that
          breeds in the Antarctic winter.
        </li>
        <li>Breeding Colonies can contain up to several thousand individual penguins.</li>

        <li>
          Emperor penguins are serially monogamous this does not mean they mate for life, but they
          will stay with each other for the course of the breeding season and raising of the chick.
          It’s a common misconception that penguin’s mate for life and they have only about a 15%
          chance of staying together beyond the season.
        </li>

        <li>Emperor penguins can dive deeper than any other bird.</li>

        <li>Its genus name “Aptendoytes” means “without-wings-diver”</li>

        <li>
          Emperor penguins have a distinct tuxedo look because under water the bellies camouflage
          them against light above and their dark backs camouflage them against the depths below.
        </li>

        <li>
          Emperor penguins leap into the air while swimming. This porpoising action coats them in
          micro air bubbles that reduces friction underwater.
