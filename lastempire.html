        The emperor penguin faces one of, if not the harshest environment the world has and its
        evolutionary biology play a large role in that survival. The emperor penguin has adapted and
        learned to survive when many other animals would not. They are thought to have come from

        but this could be a misconception as the King Penguin is <u><b>VERY</b></u> similar in
        appearance and habitats

        and other country’s that spawn the southernmost

        of our planet. It’s thought that all penguins have branched off from the emperor penguin
        over 40 million years ago.

        and the impacts from over fishing has done to their food supplies. We cannot expect 40

        conservation status to near threatened. Some scientists believe the emperor penguin may be
